    Segments structures in images based on image features derived from
    pseudo-canny-edges.

    IMPORTANT The SegmentationLevelSetImageFilter class and the
    CannySegmentationLevelSetFunction class contain additional information
    necessary to the full understanding of how to use this filter.
    OVERVIEW This class is a level set method segmentation filter. It
    constructs a speed function which is designed to lock onto edges as
    detected by a Canny filter.

    The CannySegmentationLevelSetImageFilter can be a tool for refining an
    existing segmentation, or it can be used to try to segment a region by
    itself. Like all other level-set based segmentation filters (see
    SegmentationLevelSetImageFilter), it works by first constructing a
    scalar speed term and a vector advection field based on edge features
    in the image. The level set front is then moved according to these two
    terms with the addition of a third curvature term to contol the
    smoothness of the solution.

    The speed term is constructed as the Danielsson distance transform of
    the Canny edge image, as calculated by the
    CannyEdgeDetectionImageFilter. This scalar speed can be tuned in and
    out of the final evolution equation by setting the PropagationScaling
    parameter (a value of 0 removes the speed term).

    The advection field term is constructed by minimizing Danielsson
    distance squared. i.e. $ \\mbox{min} \\int D^2 \\Rightarrow D
    \\nabla D $. This term moves the level set down the gradient of the
    distance transform.

    In practice, you may set the speed (propagation) term to zero if your
    initialization is already close to the edge you are interested in. If
    you are trying to segment a region by seeding with a small surface
    (blob, sphere) then you will likely want to add speed (propagation) to
    the equation so that the levelsets can expand along zero gradients.
    The relative influence of these two terms are controlled by the
    SetPropagationScaling and SetAdvectionScaling parameters. INPUTS This
    filter requires two inputs. The first input is a seed image. This seed
    image must contain an isosurface that you want to use as the seed for
    your segmentation. It can be a binary, graylevel, or floating point
    image. The only requirement is that it contain a closed isosurface
    that you will identify as the seed by setting the IsosurfaceValue
    parameter of the filter. For a binary image you will want to set your
    isosurface value halfway between your on and off values (i.e. for 0's
    and 1's, use an isosurface value of 0.5).

    The second input is the feature image. This is the image from which
    the speed function will be calculated. For most applications, this is
    the image that you want to segment. The desired isosurface in your
    seed image should lie within the region of your feature image that you
    are trying to segment.

    See SegmentationLevelSetImageFilter for more information on Inputs.
    OUTPUTS The filter outputs a single, scalar, real-valued image.
    Positive *values in the output image are inside the segmented region
    and negative *values in the image are outside of the inside region.
    The zero crossings of *the image correspond to the position of the
    level set front.

    See SparseFieldLevelSetImageFilter and SegmentationLevelSetImageFilter
    for more information. PARAMETERS There are five parameters important
    for controlling the behavior of this filter.

    (1) Threshold. Sets the thresholding value of the Canny edge
    detection. See CannyEdgeDetectionImageFilter for more information.

    (2) Variance. Controls the smoothing parameter of the gaussian
    filtering done during Canny edge detection.

    (3) CurvatureScaling. Controls the degree to which curvature
    influences the evolution of the level set. Higher values relative to
    Propagation and Advection scalings will yield a smoother surface.

    (4) PropagationScaling. Scales the propagation (speed) term of the
    level set equation. Set this term to zero to allow the level set to
    flow only down the gradient of the distance transform.

    (5) AdvectionScaling. Scales influence of the advection field relative
    to curvature and propagation terms.

    Segments structures in images based on image features derived from
    pseudo-canny-edges.

    IMPORTANT The SegmentationLevelSetImageFilter class and the
    CannySegmentationLevelSetFunction class contain additional information
    necessary to the full understanding of how to use this filter.
    OVERVIEW This class is a level set method segmentation filter. It
    constructs a speed function which is designed to lock onto edges as
    detected by a Canny filter.

    The CannySegmentationLevelSetImageFilter can be a tool for refining an
    existing segmentation, or it can be used to try to segment a region by
    itself. Like all other level-set based segmentation filters (see
    SegmentationLevelSetImageFilter), it works by first constructing a
    scalar speed term and a vector advection field based on edge features
    in the image. The level set front is then moved according to these two
    terms with the addition of a third curvature term to contol the
    smoothness of the solution.

    The speed term is constructed as the Danielsson distance transform of
    the Canny edge image, as calculated by the
    CannyEdgeDetectionImageFilter. This scalar speed can be tuned in and
    out of the final evolution equation by setting the PropagationScaling
    parameter (a value of 0 removes the speed term).

    The advection field term is constructed by minimizing Danielsson
    distance squared. i.e. $ \\mbox{min} \\int D^2 \\Rightarrow D
    \\nabla D $. This term moves the level set down the gradient of the
    distance transform.

    In practice, you may set the speed (propagation) term to zero if your
    initialization is already close to the edge you are interested in. If
    you are trying to segment a region by seeding with a small surface
    (blob, sphere) then you will likely want to add speed (propagation) to
    the equation so that the levelsets can expand along zero gradients.
    The relative influence of these two terms are controlled by the
    SetPropagationScaling and SetAdvectionScaling parameters. INPUTS This
    filter requires two inputs. The first input is a seed image. This seed
    image must contain an isosurface that you want to use as the seed for
    your segmentation. It can be a binary, graylevel, or floating point
    image. The only requirement is that it contain a closed isosurface
    that you will identify as the seed by setting the IsosurfaceValue
    parameter of the filter. For a binary image you will want to set your
    isosurface value halfway between your on and off values (i.e. for 0's
    and 1's, use an isosurface value of 0.5).

    The second input is the feature image. This is the image from which
    the speed function will be calculated. For most applications, this is
    the image that you want to segment. The desired isosurface in your
    seed image should lie within the region of your feature image that you
    are trying to segment.

    See SegmentationLevelSetImageFilter for more information on Inputs.
    OUTPUTS The filter outputs a single, scalar, real-valued image.
    Positive *values in the output image are inside the segmented region
    and negative *values in the image are outside of the inside region.
    The zero crossings of *the image correspond to the position of the
    level set front.

    See SparseFieldLevelSetImageFilter and SegmentationLevelSetImageFilter
    for more information. PARAMETERS There are five parameters important
    for controlling the behavior of this filter.

    (1) Threshold. Sets the thresholding value of the Canny edge
    detection. See CannyEdgeDetectionImageFilter for more information.

    (2) Variance. Controls the smoothing parameter of the gaussian
    filtering done during Canny edge detection.

    (3) CurvatureScaling. Controls the degree to which curvature
    influences the evolution of the level set. Higher values relative to
    Propagation and Advection scalings will yield a smoother surface.

    (4) PropagationScaling. Scales the propagation (speed) term of the
    level set equation. Set this term to zero to allow the level set to
    flow only down the gradient of the distance transform.

    (5) AdvectionScaling. Scales influence of the advection field relative
    to curvature and propagation terms.

        New() tries to assign all the non named parameters to the input of the new objects - the
        first non named parameter in the first input, etc.

        The named parameters are used by calling the method with the same name prefixed by 'Set'.

        Ex:

          itkCannySegmentationLevelSetImageFilterIF4IF4F.New(reader, threshold=10)

        is (most of the time) equivalent to:

          obj = itkCannySegmentationLevelSetImageFilterIF4IF4F.New()
          obj.SetInput(0, reader.GetOutput())
          obj.SetThreshold(10)
        """
        obj = itkCannySegmentationLevelSetImageFilterIF4IF4F.__New_orig__()
        from itk.support import template_class
        template_class.New(obj, *args, **kargs)
