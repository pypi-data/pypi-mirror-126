Description: OpenEmbedding is a distributed framework to accelerate TensorFlow training and
        support TensorFlow Serving. It uses the parameter server architecture to store
        the Embedding Layer. So that single machine memory is not the limit of model size.
        OpenEmbedding can cooperate with all-reduce framework to support both data parallel
        and model parallel.
