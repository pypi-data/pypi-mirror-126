# What is this?
Tinybird Analytics is a blazing fast analytics engine for your serverless applications.
Think of it as a set of next-generation lego pieces for building data workflows and applications which rely on real-time analytics.

# Developing tinybird.co?

### Installing the development environment

1. Compile or install clickhouse:
    
    a. Compiling clickhouse yourself. You'll need 70 GB of free disk space. It is recommended to use our production version (v20.7.2.30) following its compilation docs: https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/blob/v20.7.2.30-stable/docs/en/development/build.md . Install your compiled clickhouse using `sudo ninja install`.


    b. Using Docker: [Install docker](https://docs.docker.com/install/) and run the clickhouse container

    ```bash
    docker run -d --name tt -p 9000:9000 -p 8123:8123 --ulimit nofile=262144:262144 yandex/clickhouse-server
    ```

    Remember that if at any time you stop the docker container you will lose any data you may have imported to your clickhouse instance.

    c. Using Docker with ClickHouse `tinybird` cluster

    ```bash
    docker build --tag tinybird/clickhouse --file docker/tinybird-clickhouse.Dockerfile .
    docker run -d --name tb-ch -p 9000:9000 -p 8123:8123 --ulimit nofile=262144:262144 tinybird/clickhouse
    ```

    d. Use a pre-built binary, check https://clickhouse.tech/docs/en/development/build/#you-don-t-have-to-build-clickhouse. (see FAQ: using native clickhouse clickhouse builds with osx)

2. Install and configure Redis

On MacOS:

```bash
brew install redis
```

On Ubuntu/Debian:
```bash
sudo apt install redis-server
```
Then modify `/etc/redis/redis.conf` and change line `supervised no` to `supervised systemd`.
Lastly, start the service with `sudo systemctl restart redis`. You can also enable it to be automatically
started on boot: `sudo systemctl enable redis`

3. Install Zookeeper

```bash
# On Ubuntu:
sudo apt install zookeeperd
```

```bash
# On Mac:
brew install zookeeper
```

3. Checkout this repo

4. Install Python >= 3.8.8 (any version 3.8.X >= 3.8.8 should work as well)

**On Ubuntu**

```bash
sudo apt install python3-pip libcurl4-openssl-dev libsqlite3-dev liblzma-dev
```

Install pyenv to use the recommended python version (3.8.8), following https://github.com/pyenv/pyenv-installer 

Then install python 3.8.8 and set it as the default for our analytics directory:
```bash
# analytics is this cloned repo path
cd analytics/
CONFIGURE_OPTS=--enable-shared pyenv install 3.8.8
pyenv local 3.8.8
```

**On MacOS 11.X**

Install system dependencies (https://github.com/pyenv/pyenv/wiki#troubleshooting--faq):

If you haven't done so, install Xcode Command Line Tools (xcode-select --install) and Homebrew. Then:
```bash
brew install openssl readline sqlite3 xz zlib
```

Install pyenv, following https://github.com/pyenv/pyenv-installer

Install Python >= 3.8.8:
```bash
pyenv install 3.8.8
```
Set it as a global version if you want to always use this one:
```bash
pyenv global 3.8.8
```


5. Create your mvenv and install all dependencies:

    **A. Straightforward way:**

    ```bash
    pyenv exec python3 -m venv .e
    . .e/bin/activate
    PYCURL_SSL_LIBRARY=openssl pip install --editable .
    ```
    (--editable option means you can change code inside tinybird folder). Note that you need, at least, clickhouse headers in order to install python dependencies

    **B. You might get an error like this on OSX 11.X:**

    ```bash
    ImportError: pycurl: libcurl link-time ssl backend (none/other) is different from compile-time ssl backend (openssl)
    ```

    If that's the case, try installing `pycurl` like this (use the required pycurl version):

    ```bash
    brew install openssl curl-openssl
    python3 -mvenv .e
    . .e/bin/activate
   
    # Needs the latest pip version to correctly install clickhouse-toolset
    pip install --upgrade pip
   
    # Install pycurl with the correct openssl files. After this, to check if pycurl is correctly installed and configured,
    # executing "python -c 'import pycurl'" must return nothing.  
    export PYCURL_SSL_LIBRARY=openssl;export LDFLAGS='-L/usr/local/opt/openssl/lib -L/usr/local/opt/c-ares/lib -L/usr/local/opt/nghttp2/lib -L/usr/local/opt/libmetalink/lib -L/usr/local/opt/rtmpdump/lib -L/usr/local/opt/libssh2/lib -L/usr/local/opt/openldap/lib -L/usr/local/opt/brotli/lib';export CPPFLAGS=-I/usr/local/opt/openssl/include;pip install pycurl==7.43.0.6 --compile --no-cache-dir

    # Finally install the rest of dependencies.
    pip install --editable .
    ```

6. Config flake8 to prevent lint errors on commit:

    ```bash
    git config --bool flake8.strict true
    ```

7. Extra system-wide configuration

On Linux, increase the max number of opened files:
```bash
ulimit -n 8096
```
To make that change persistent, you will need to edit `/etc/security/limits.conf`.

If your Clickhouse binary is not in the system path, you will need to
set *CLICKHOUSE_BIN_FOLDER_PATH* environment variable on your session, for
example adding it to your shell init scripts (likely `~/.bashrc` or `~/.zshrc`).
This will be an example for a self-compiled installation:

```bash
# On self-compiled installation (Ubuntu):
export CLICKHOUSE_BIN_FOLDER_PATH=/usr/local/bin/
```

8. Configure your Clickhouse

* Copy config from CI tests
```bash
# On Linux:
sudo su
echo '127.0.0.1 clickhouse-01 clickhouse-02' >> /etc/hosts
cp -r tests/clickhouse_config/* /etc/clickhouse-server/
mkdir -p /etc/clickhouse-server/config.d/
cp tests/clickhouse_config/macros/127.0.0.1.xml /etc/clickhouse-server/config.d/macros.xml
```

* Set a persistent data path

Modify `/etc/clickhouse-server/config.xml` to change the data directory:
```xml
    <!-- Path to data directory, with trailing slash. -->
    <path>/var/lib/clickhouse/</path>
```

And ensure it exists with proper permissions:
```bash
sudo mkdir /var/lib/clickhouse
sudo chown clickhouse /var/lib/clickhouse
```

**Important note:** on OSX you need to configure the TCP port to 9001 due to a bug in clickhouse-local that limits connections to the default port.

9. Install Kafka [optional]

Download https://www.apache.org/dyn/closer.cgi?path=/kafka/2.8.0/kafka_2.13-2.8.0.tgz

To avoid having to setup the KAFKA_PATH envvar, decompress it on the parent folder of analytics:
wadus/analytics
wadus/kafka_2.13-2.8.0


### Start Clickhouse and zookeeper

Leave opened the zookeeper service:
```bash
# On Linux:
sudo /usr/share/zookeeper/bin/zkServer.sh start-foreground
```

Start a clickhouse server:
```bash
sudo -u clickhouse clickhouse-server --config-file=/etc/clickhouse-server/config.xml
```


### Testing locally

1. Install testing dependencies

```bash
pip install -e ".[test]"
```

2. Run the tests with [pytest](https://docs.pytest.org/en/stable/usage.html):

* To run all tests

```bash
pytest tests
```

* There're several options, for example, testing a single file:

```bash
pytest tests/views/test_api_datasources.py -vv
```

* Running a single test:

```bash
pytest tests/views/test_api_datasources.py -k test_name
```



### Starting the development environment

```bash
tinybird_server --port 8001
```

**Important note:** on OSX add `OBJC_DISABLE_INITIALIZE_FORK_SAFETY` as follows

```bash
OBJC_DISABLE_INITIALIZE_FORK_SAFETY=YES tinybird_server --port 8001
```

### Useful commands

If running CH with docker, you can do the following to connect to clickhouse client
```bash
docker exec -it tt clickhouse client
```

# Developing in the UI

You need, at least, **node** version 12 in order to have the UI running in your local development. Then, in the root of the project:

```bash
npm install
npm run dev:build
```

If you want to make changes and check how they look:

```bash
npm run dev:watch
```

Don't forget to test your changes:

```bash
npm run test
```

Or test + watch ü§ó:

```bash
npm run test:watch
```

You have more information about development [here](development.md).

# FAQ
### What do I do to validate my development environment is working correctly?
Browse to http://localhost:8001/dashboard. You'll be prompted to login with your gmail account. Go back to /dashboard once you do and try importing

### I can't connect to clickhouse with tinybird configuration!
```bash
clickhouse client -h clickhouse-01
```

### Where is the marketing website code?
It is in the `index.html` page.

### Where is the blog hosted?
It is generated with Jekyll, and it is located in other [repository](https://gitlab.com/tinybird/blog).

### How can I see the documentation?
There is an automatic deploy job created so every time you merge something in master, if everything goes OK, the latest version of the documentation will be available at https://docs.tinybird.co

## using native clickhouse clickhouse builds with osx

### 1. Using the latest version of Clickhouse already compiled
```bash
curl -O 'https://builds.clickhouse.tech/master/macos/clickhouse' && chmod a+x ./clickhouse
wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/master/programs/server/config.xml
wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/master/programs/server/users.xml
sudo ./clickhouse server --config config.xml
```

### 2. Recommended: Use the Clickhouse version used in production (20.7.2.30 at 2020-01-19)

To get Clickhouse, you have two options:
- A: Download the compiled version from github from the version you need: `go to commits page, click on the first green checkmark or red cross near commit, and click to the ‚ÄúDetails‚Äù link right after ‚ÄúClickHouse Build Check‚Äù.`
- B: If you can't find the version you need (the store binaries just for a while), compile your own version following the steps in the documentation. Remember to use the documentation for your version, as the instructions varies between them. You will find those docs inside the repository.

You can find the configuration files (`config.xml` and `users.xml`) inside `tests/clickhouse_config`. Change the configuration paths as you need.

Execute clickhouse as always: `./clickhouse server --config config.xml`

# Building a new CI docker container image

```bash
# Build a new image `test-tmp
docker build -t test-tmp:latest -f gitlab/tests-integration.Dockerfile docker-tmp/

# Login, you'll need to create a new gitlab API token
docker login registry.gitlab.com

# Tag & push your image
docker tag test-tmp registry.gitlab.com/tinybird/analytics/test-tmp
docker push registry.gitlab.com/tinybird/analytics/test-tmp
```

Note: Docker images contain the analytics python dependencies. If you change the dependencies in any of the `setup.py` files it'll work, but ideally you should include it in the Docker images as well.

# Debugging problems in gitlab CI

You can use `gitlab-runner` to execute any `.gitlab-ci.yml` job locally. Follow these steps to debug any of those jobs:

- Modify the `.gitlab-ci.yml` file, including `tail -f /dev/null` in the script section of the job
- Run the job you need with gitlab-runner, for instance: `gitlab-runner exec docker tests_integration_ch_207_py38`
- Wait until the container stops in `tail -f /dev/null`
- `docker ps` to list the name of the Docker container
- Open a shell session inside the container `docker exec -it <docker_name_from_previous_step> /bin/bash`
- Now you can run anything you need to debug, including breakpoints with pdb, etc.
- Once you finish stop the container `docker stop <docker_name>`

Note: If you do any modification to a project file, you need to commit it in order to be available in the Docker container. Once you finish you can squash all the commits.
