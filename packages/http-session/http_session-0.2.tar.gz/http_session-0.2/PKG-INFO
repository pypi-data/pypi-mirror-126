Description: http-session
        ************
        
        ``http_session`` is the foundation of a session management system.
        The provided prototypes allow implementations using a wide array of
        backends.
        
        ``http_session`` relies on three components:
        
        The "store" prototyped in `http_session.meta.Store`
        represents a store handling sessions. This store knows how to
        retrieve, persist, clear or create sessions, using their SID.
        
        The "session" implemented in `http_session.session.Session` represents
        the session iself. It is discriminated by its sid and is able to set
        and get key/value pairs and track the modifications and accesses.
        
        The "manager" oversees the store and session, in order to interface
        them with the browser. It is mainly used as a SID policy and middleware.
        A functional implementation using secure cookies is provided in
        `http_session.cookie.SignedCookieManager`.
