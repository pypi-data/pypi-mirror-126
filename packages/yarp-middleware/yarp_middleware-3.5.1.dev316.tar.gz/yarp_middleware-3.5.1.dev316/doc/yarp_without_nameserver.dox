/**
\page yarp_without_nameserver Using YARP without a name server

YARP programs usually expect a special YARP name server to be running.
This can be avoided, if you decide to allocate names yourself.
If you call a port by a name with a tcp socket number in it:

~~~{.cpp}
Port p;
p.open("/myhost:9999");
~~~

Then no name server is needed.
