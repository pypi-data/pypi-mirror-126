# BioLectorPy
This package is used to plot results from cultivations in a BioLector. This is an ongoing development where functionality is expanded as needed. The input files are the xlsx-spreadsheets that can be exported from the BioLection software and a simple csv-file (see example) that describes the content of each well in the wellplate. 
Current features include:
 - Support of both BioLector and BioLector Pro
 - Combine data from multiple experiments
 - Plotting of any parameter (pH, DO, biomass) for:
   - Individual wells
   - Each strain / species across medium conditions
   - Multiple species across one or more medium conditions
 - Well-plate plots summarizing results, e.g. in terms of max-growth rate, fold-increase etc.
 - Estimation of growth rates based on Generalized additive models
