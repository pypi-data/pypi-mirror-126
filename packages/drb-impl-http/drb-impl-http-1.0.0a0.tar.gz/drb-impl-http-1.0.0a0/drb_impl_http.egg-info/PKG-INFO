# Http & Https Implementation
This drb-impl-http module implements http and https protocol access with DRB data model. It is able to get read object using the http protocol or the https protocol.

## Http Factory and Http Node
The module implements the basic factory model defined in DRB in its node resolver. Based on the python entry point mechanism, this module can be dynamically imported into applications.

The entry point group reference is `drb.impl`.<br/>
The implementation name is `http`.<br/>
The factory class is encoded into `drb_impl_http.drb_impl_http`.<br/>

The HttpNode can be instantiated from an uri. The `ParsedPath` class provided in drb core module can help to manage these inputs.

## Using this module
To include this module into your project, the `drb-impl-http` module shall be referenced into `requirement.txt` file, or the following pip line can be run:

```commandline
pip install drb-impl-file
```
