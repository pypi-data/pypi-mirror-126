# DRSlib - a set of utilities by DavidRodriguezSoaresCUI

DRSlib is a Python package that provides a wide range of small
yet powerful set of highly-reusable functions, classes, 
decorators, etc. Its main purpose is to provide high-level
"building blocks" that accomplish simple tasks, facilitating
the writing of elaborate scripts with limited code.
