Description: # DRSlib - a set of utilities by DavidRodriguezSoaresCUI
        
        DRSlib is a Python package that provides a wide range of small
        yet powerful set of highly-reusable functions, classes, 
        decorators, etc. Its main purpose is to provide high-level
        "building blocks" that accomplish simple tasks, facilitating
        the writing of elaborate scripts with limited code.

        ## Install
        
        You can install DRSlib using the pip package manager:
        - On Unix/macOS: ```python3 -m pip install DRSlib-DavidRodriguezSoaresCUI```
        - On Windows: ```python -m pip install DRSlib-DavidRodriguezSoaresCUI```
        
        You may need to use elevated permissions to install a package, or use a variation of this command on your specific system. There are plenty of tutorials on the Internet if you need help.
        
        ## Versioning
        
        This package adheres to [PEP 440](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0440), specifically follows version scheme example `"major.minor" versioning with developmental releases, release candidates and post-releases for minor corrections`.
        
        
        ## Packaging
        
        I followed [this python.org tutorial](https://packaging.python.org/tutorials/packaging-projects/).
