        **UIB - V Features** is a library to extract useful features of different types(morphological, texture 
        and color). To increase the flexibility of the library all functions can be used with masks or contours. 
        
        UIB - V Features was originally developed by researchers of [UGIVIA](http://ugivia.uib.es/). This research group
        is centered on computer vision and artificial intelligence. 
        
        All the features available are grouped in one iterator to simplify the use of this library.
        
        ### Installation
        
        Install the library is very simple with pip
        
        ```
        $ pip install uib-vfeatures
        ```

        ## Demo
        
        We're going to use our library with a mask image .
        
        ```python
        from uib_vfeatures.masks import Masks
        from uib_vfeatures import Features_mask as ftrs
        import cv2
        
        ```
        First of all we read the image from a file, then we try our features with visualizations. We only have 
        three features with visualization: the bounding box area, the eccentricity and the solidity. 
        
        ```python
        mask = cv2.imread("mask.jpg")
        
        Masks.bounding_box_area(mask, True)
        
        Masks.eccentricity(mask, True)
        Masks.solidity(mask, True)
        ```
        
        ### Iterator
        
        You can use an iterator and implement every morpholical feature. 
        
        ```python
        features = {}
        
        for key, func in features.items():
            features[key] = func(mask)
        
        ```
        As a result we had a dicctionary of the form *{'Feature_name': value}*
