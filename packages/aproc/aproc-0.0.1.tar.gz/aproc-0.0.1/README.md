# aproc - for asynchronous multiprocessing
`aproc` extends the multiprocessing library by combining a multiprocessing pool with a multiprocessing queue.

[![Python package](https://github.com/pyiron/aproc/workflows/Python%20package/badge.svg)](https://github.com/pyiron/aproc/actions)
[![Coverage Status](https://coveralls.io/repos/github/pyiron/aproc/badge.svg?branch=master)](https://coveralls.io/github/pyiron/aproc?branch=master)

# Installation
aproc can either be installed via pip using:

    pip install aproc

Or via anaconda from the conda-forge channel

    conda install -c conda-forge aproc

# Usage 

    from aproc import Pool
    
    # Define function to be executed in subprocess 
    def print_function(args):
        print(args)
    
    # Dynamically extend the list of objects to be processed by placing them in the pool
    with Pool(processes=2, initializer=print_function) as pool:
        pool.put(1)
        pool.put("two")
        pool.put({"three": 3})
        pool.put([4])

In addition `aproc` also supports bidirectional communication: 

    from aproc import Pool
    
    # Define function to be executed in subprocess, which returns a response
    def both_way(args):
        return args
    
    # Dynamically extend the list of objects to be processed by placing them in the pool
    with Pool(processes=2, initializer=print_function, bidirectional=True) as pool:
        pool.put(1)
        print(pool.get())
        pool.put("two")
        pool.put({"three": 3})
        pool.put([4])
        print(pool.get())
        print(pool.get())
        print(pool.get())
