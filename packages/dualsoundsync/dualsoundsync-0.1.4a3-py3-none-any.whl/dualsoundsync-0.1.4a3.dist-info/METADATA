# dualsoundsync

## Warning: this is at pre-alpha stage (crappy code ahead)

`dualsoundsync` is a python command to sync audio and video files shot
with [dual system sound][] using a specific hardware timecode generator
called [the atomicsynchronator][]. The timecode is called YaLTC for *yet
another longitudinal time code* and should be recorded on a scratch
track on each device for the syncing to be performed.

## Installation

    $ pip install dualsoundsync


## Usage

The command takes one argument: the folder containing all the files from
the camera and from the audio recoder. _Those recordings should contain an AUX audio track with encoded YaLTC_

    $ dualsoundsync <path to rushes folder>

If you want to try it out but don't have yet built your own
atomicsynchronator, you can download some sample files with YaLTC from the
[repo][].

## Output

### Messages

Some stdout outputs will be written (time is UTC):

### Folder and files created

A logfile named `out.txt` with `loguru` messages is dumped in the
current directory. Inside the *rushes_folder* those nested
subdirectories are created:

-   `dualsoundsync/split/` contains all audio split into Right and Left
    channels and video files split from their audio.
-   `dualsoundsync/synced/` contains video files with their synced sound
    track.
