"""Helpers for the Click commands defined in `pod_store.__main__`.

These things were moved out to keep the spaghetti to a minimum in __main__.

Helpers for a specific command are stored in a specific module named for that command.

    pod_store.commands.ls

Other modules contain general helpers reused in multiple commands.
