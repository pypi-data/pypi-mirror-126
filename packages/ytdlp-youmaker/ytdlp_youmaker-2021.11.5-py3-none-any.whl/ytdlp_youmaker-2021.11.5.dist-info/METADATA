## yt-dlp

yt-dlp is a [youtube-dl](https://github.com/ytdl-org/youtube-dl) fork based on the now
inactive [youtube-dlc](https://github.com/blackjack4494/yt-dlc). The main focus of this project is adding new features
and patches while also keeping up to date with the original project

Note that **all** plugins are imported even if not invoked, and that **there are no checks** performed on plugin code.
Use plugins at your own risk and only if you trust the code
