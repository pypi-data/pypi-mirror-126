"""`PUT Vein`_ is a database for biometric palm and wrist vein recognition.

PUT Vein pattern database consists of 2400 images presenting human vein patterns.
Half of images (1200 images) contain a palm vein pattern and the remaining images contain a wrist vein pattern (another 1200 images).
Data was acquired from both hands of 50 students. Thus, it has 100 different patterns for palm and wrist region.
Pictures ware taken in 3 series, 4 pictures each, with at least one week interval between each series.
Images in database have 1280x960 resolution and are stored as 24-bit bitmap. Database consist of 2 main splits:
hand and wrist, allowing to investigate both modalities.
The reference citation is [KK10]_.

You can download the raw data of the `PUT Vein`_ database by following
