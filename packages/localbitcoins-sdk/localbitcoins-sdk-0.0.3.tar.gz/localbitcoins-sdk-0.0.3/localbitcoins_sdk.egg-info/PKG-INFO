Description: # localbitcoins-sdk
        A simple library for working with LocalBitcoins API
        
        I created this library to make it easier to use the **LocalBitcoins API**.
        The library is very simple. 
        It has just one object `Client`, with one custom method `send_request`.
        
        ## How to use it?
        ### Install it
        ```shell
        pip install localbitcoins-sdk
        ```
        ### Use it
        ```python
        # Import the Client
        from lb_sdk import Client
        
        # Create a Client object with the hmac key and the hmac secret from localbitcoins.
        client = Client('your-hmac-key-here', 'your-hmac-secret-here')
        
        # Send a request and get a response data.
        data = client.send_request('/api/myself')
        ```
