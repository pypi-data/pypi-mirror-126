    This class was initially developed to accomodate fast, high-precision sparse
    matrix multiplications and powers. WARNING! This class does not covers all
    matrix operations, it only cover the basic operations used by PyNUCTRAN, i.e.
    Multiplication and Powers.
   
    This class uses the basic Python dictionaries to store data. Sparse matrix
    elements are accessed at an incredible speed via the use of hash table.

    Of course, the existing SCIPY library can be used, however, it does not allow
    dtype=Decimal, and this is frustrating. Therefore, I must endure writing a new
    specialized class handling sparse matrix power to preserve the accuracy.

    SPARSE STORAGE. Only the non-zero elements are stored in smatrix.data dictio-
    nary. The keys of smatrix.data are the tuple specifying the position of the
    non-zero elements in the dense matrix version. smatrix.common_column (cc) and 
    smatrix.common_rows (cr) are dictionaries that stores the collection (also a dict.)
    of position tuples with common column or row indices, respectively. The keys are
    the common column/row indices.

    SPARSE MULTIPLICATION. Consider sparse matrices A and B. We want to evaluate A*B.
    Here we implement the row-wise multiplication algorithm. Each row can be vectorized
    into multiple concurrent threads.

    For a more comprehensive understanding, consider reading the code below. Good luck!

    SPARSE POWER. Suppose we want to evaluate the power of a sparse matrix, i.e. A^n.
    Let n be a large integer number. A naive method is given by,

    A^n = A x A x A x .... (n times)

    Fortunately, this process can be accelerated using the binary decomposition method,
    for instance,

    let C = A x A (power raised to 2)
    C = C x C     (power raised to 4)
    C = C x C     (power raised to 8)
    :
    :
    until... 
    C = C x C     (power raised to n)

    This algorithm has a complexity of O(log n).
