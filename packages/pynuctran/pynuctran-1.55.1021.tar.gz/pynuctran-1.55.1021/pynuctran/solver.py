SECTION II: PyNUCTRAN SOLVER MODULE............................................ SEC. II
A PYTHON LIBRARY FOR NUCLEAR TRANSMUTATION SOLVER (PyNUCTRAN)
License: MIT

Initially developed, designed  and  proposed  by M. R. Omar for the purpose of 
simulating various nuclear transmutations such as decays,  fissions as well as 
neutron  absorptions.  PYNUCTRAN was developed to avoid cumbersome 
numerical issues of solving the nuclide depletion equations.

This code does not directly solve  Bateman's  equations.  Instead, it uses the 
pi-distribution to  estimate  the  evolution  of  species  concentrations in a 
nuclide depletion problem. The pi-distribution is given by

    pi(i,l) = c * product(j=1 to J_i) d(j,l) + (-1)**d(j,l) * exp(-rate(j)*dt)

c is the normalization factor of the distribution.
pi(i,0) is the probability of no removal happens.
rate(j) is the rate of transmutation event-j.
d(j,l) is the kronecker delta.
dt is the time substep interval.


define w as an array consists of the current weight of all isotopes.
define I as the total number of isotopes
define J(i) as the total number of transmutation events for isotope-i.

The calculation is based on the following iteration,

    w(t) = A^(t/dt) w(0)

where w(0) is the initial concentration of all species, A is the transfer matrix 
which is defined as follows:
        _                      _
        |   p(1->1) ... p(I->1)  |
    A = |     :     '.     :     |
        |_  p(1->I) ... p(I->I) _|

and p(i->k) is the transfer probability which can be derived using
pi-distribution using the following formula,

    p(k->i) = sum of pi(k,j) for all events j that mutates 
              species k into i.

note also that matrix A  is a square matrix (IxI) with its columns as the parent
species and rows as the daughter species. Also, w and w(0) are Lx1 column matrix.

        prepare_transfer_matrix(dt) is a function that constructs the transfer matrix,
        based on the provided removal events parameters specified via add_removal(...)
        method. dt=time_step/substeps is the substep interval.
        
        TODO: To further clean-up the code for fast and efficient computation of the 
        transfer matrix.

        Update-1: Of course, understanding the math of preparing the transfer matrix
        is relatively easy and straightforward. Unfortunately, the matrix preparation
        requires high presicion calculation. Even a small binary operation float error
        will affect the accuracy of pi-distribution. Therefore, I preserved high
        presicion calculation for the calculation of pi-distribution. Once the distri-
        bution is computed, it is converted into np.longfloat and the transfer matrix
        is saved using the Compressed Sparse Row (CSR) format.
