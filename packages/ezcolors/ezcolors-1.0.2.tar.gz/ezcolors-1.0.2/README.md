A simple library that contains a ColorColour class for fast and easy definition of colours in python.  

you can define a colour from  

hex -- Colour(#ff00ff)  
RGB -- Colour(255, 0, 255)    
rgba -- Colour(255, 0, 255, 128)  
hsl -- Colour(hsl = [270, 100, 50])  
hsv -- Colour(hsv = [270, 100, 100])  
colour name -- Colour(Light Purple)  

with these colours you can then  

perform math upon it  
translate it to any color space  
compare it to other colours  
colour a string with ANSI escape sequences  
generate a colour palette with various different colour harmonies (see palettes module)
