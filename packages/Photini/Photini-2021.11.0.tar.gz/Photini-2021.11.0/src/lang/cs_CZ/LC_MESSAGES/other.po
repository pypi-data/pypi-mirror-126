"Amongst the commonly used image metadata items are the latitude and "

"people argue that it should be the position of the subject of the "

"easy to set the latitude and longitude of any photograph by dragging and "

"There are currently four map tabs in the Photini editor, each of which "
"gets maps (or aerial photographs) from a different provider: Google, "
"Microsoft Bing, Mapbox, and Open Street Map. (Each of these providers has"
" terms and conditions you should read and accept before using their "
"maps.) The maps differ in appearance, and show different levels of detail"
" for different parts of the world. You should use the one that you like "
"best, but it's very easy to switch to another at any time."
