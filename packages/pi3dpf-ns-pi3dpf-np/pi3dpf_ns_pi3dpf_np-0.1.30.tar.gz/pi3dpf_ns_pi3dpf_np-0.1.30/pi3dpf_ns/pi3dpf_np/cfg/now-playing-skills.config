# config file name: now-playing-skills.config
# This is a config file used by now-playing.py to identify information on the 'Now Playing' tab of the Amazon Alexa Webpage.
# Entries from 1) /opt/venvs/pi3d-pictureframe/lib/python*/site-packages/pi3dpf/cfg/now-playing-skills.config will be merged with the
# ones in 2) /home/pi/.pf/alexa/now-playing-skills.config where the latter (2) overwrites any existing entries of the former (1).
# Example: assume the entry 'Deezer' exists in both 1) and 2), then only 'Deezer' (2) will be effective.
# Filenames for 1) and 2) cannot be changed, they are hard wired in now-playing.py (WhatsPlayingAlexa.py)
#
# Description of Skills:
#   Unfortunately, Skills like Pandora is geo blocking non US users for licensing reasons and I cannot test myself.
#   For such Skills, you may use below Skill entry 'Test' - by copying to 2) - which has the additional benefit of
#   being more verbose when errors occur. Once you are satified with the quality of the XPATH specs, feel free to
#   add a new entry to 2) and send me a copy for adding to 1).
#
# Description of "skills" elements:
#   - enabled: Skill will be ignored when not set as 'true'
#   - [x] id: idemtifying string pattern when Skill is active
#   - skill_in_id: most Skills identify in the 'id' entry with their name. Others, like TuneIn not. Set latter to 'false'
#   - ad: string shown in playlist when advertisement is active
#   - [x] station: Radio Station (TuneIn only)
#   - [x] song: song at play
#   - [x] artist: artist
#   - format: Instructions to expand elements. See below.
#   - debug: 'true' when more details on Skill needs to be shown
#   [x] Elements require an XPATH expression. Examples see below.
#
# Description of "formats" elements:
#   - Plex is internally used when Plex Media Center is enabled. Do not remove
#   - you may use less than 3 elements. Using >3 elements will blow the layout out of proportion.
#   - Expanding string patterns: '$echo_device', '$skill', '$song', '$artist', '$station', '$hostname'.
#
# Description of "MRM-groups" elements:
#   - add the names of the Multi-Room Music Groups you set up in your Alexa app and their members
#   - add to 2) as this is specific to your setup. Should be empty in 1)
#   - ...
#
# Description of "enabled-skills" elements:
#   - not yet implemented, but needed to prevent users from editing 1)
#   - should also support some means to enable debugging of a Skill on the fly
#
# Notes:
#   - To disable an Skill entry from being used, specify 'null', without quotes. (will be converted to None)
#   - Use Skill 'Test' by adding to 2) and play with the setting, observe logs in /home/pi/.pf/logs/now-playing.log
#   - changes to 1) or 2) will be detected while now-playing.py is running. Check log for details.
