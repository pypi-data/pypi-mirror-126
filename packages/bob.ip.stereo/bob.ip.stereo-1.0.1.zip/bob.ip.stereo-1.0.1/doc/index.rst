Bob IP Stereo
=============

This package provides a wrapper to OpenCV's stereo reconstruction algorithm through
an user friendly interface. In addition, algorithms allowing re-projection (or re-mapping)
of an arbitrary camera viewport image into another is provided, allowing seemless 
use of images, or videos, captured in multi-camera machine vision setups.
