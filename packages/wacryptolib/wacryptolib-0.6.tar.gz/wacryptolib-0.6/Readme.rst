Summary
----------------

**WARNING, HUGE REFACTORING OF THIS LIB WILL SOON OCCUR**

This lib gathers utilities to generate and store cryptographic keys, and encrypt/decrypt/sign container, for the
WitnessAngel project.

It defines a container format which allows multiple agents (the user's device as well as trusted-third-parties) to
add layers of encryption and signature to the sensitive data.

It also provides utilities for webservices and their error handling, as well as test-helpers so that software using
the library may easily check that their own subclasses respect the invariants of this system.


CLI interface
----------------

You can play with containers using this command line interface.

beware, unless you provide your own crypto-config, these CLI-generated containers will use a hard-coded and simple cryptographic conf, using only locally-stored keys, so they will be insecure.

::

    $ python -m wacryptolib encrypt -i <data-file> -o <container-file>

    $ python -m wacryptolib decrypt -i <container-file> -o <data-file>
