## Q&A

> Is it possible to have other, maybe custom, assistants?

Not at the moment but if you can draw ascii art please submit a PR.

> Will this package break `try` `except` blocks?

No it only changes the way exceptions are printed not the actual exception.

> Is this code "production ready"

Don't.

> Will you get sued by Microsoft?

Hopefully my ascii art is ugly enough I can claim it's an original character.
