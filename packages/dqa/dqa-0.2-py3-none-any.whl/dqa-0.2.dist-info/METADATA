## Installation
To install with pypi, use:
```
pip install dqa
```

## Quick Start
Open file ```config.ini ``` and set the following parameters: ```LOG_FILE_PATH ``` and 
 ```OUTPUT_DIR ``` for your environment. Next, open file ```example.py``` and change ```file_path``` to point to your 
(context) document. Note that this version currently only supports ```.docx``` files. 

If you want to pose predefined questions, set ```questions``` in ```config.ini ``` to your list of questions:
```
questions = ['What is the subject?', 'Who bought the food?']
```
If you want to pose questions interactively, set ```questions``` in ```config.ini ``` to None:
```
questions = None
```
To run ```example.py```, use:
```
python example.py
```
