# PTINSEARCHER
> Web sources information extractor

ptinsearcher is a tool for extracting information from web sources. This tool allows dumping of HTML comments, e-mail addresses, phone numbers, IP addresses, subdomains, HTML forms, links and metadata of documents.

## Installation

pip install ptinsearcher
```

## Add to PATH
If you cannot invoke the script in your terminal, its probably because its not in your PATH. Fix it by running commands below.
```bash
echo "export PATH=\"`python3 -m site --user-base`/bin:\$PATH\"" >> ~/.bashrc
source ~/.bashrc
```

ptinsearcher -f urlList.txt                         # Load list of sources to grab from file
