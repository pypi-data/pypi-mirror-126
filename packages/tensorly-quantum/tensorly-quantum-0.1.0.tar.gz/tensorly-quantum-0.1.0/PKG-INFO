        ================
        
        
        TensorLy-Quantum is a Python library for Tensor-Based Quantum Machine Learning that
        builds on top of `TensorLy <https://github.com/tensorly/tensorly/>`_
        and `PyTorch <https://pytorch.org/>`_.
        
        - **Website:** http://tensorly.org/quantum/
        - **Source-code:**  https://github.com/tensorly/quantum
        
        With TensorLy-Quantum, you can easily: 
        
        - **Create large quantum circuit**: Tensor network formalism requires up to exponentially less memory for quantum simulation than traditional vector and matrix approaches.
        - **Leverage tensor methods**: the state vectors are efficiently represented in factorized form as Tensor-Rings (MPS) and the operators as TT-Matrices (MPO)
        - **Efficient simulation**: tensorly-quantum leverages the factorized structure to efficiently perform quantum simulation without ever forming the full, dense operators and state-vectors
        - **Multi-Basis Encoding**: we provide multi-basis encoding out-of-the-box for scalable experimentation
        - **Solve hard problems**: we provide all the tools to solve the MaxCut problem for an unprecendented number of qubits / vertices
