class Geography:
    '''
    This is a base class for all viridicle simulations. It must be used in a
    subclass.

    In all :class:`Geography` s, the local behavior of the system is specified
    using one property, the 4-dimensional :class:`numpy.ndarray` beta. beta
    specifies the rate at which transitions occur: in every time step, we
    randomly select a pair of neighboring sites. If (cur_state_1, cur_state_2)
    is the current states of those sites, then the probability that they
    transition in that time step to (new_state_1, new_state_2) is given by
    beta[cur_state_1, cur_state_2, new_state_1, new_state_2].

    Besides beta, the current state of the system is specified by a property
    sites. In most :class:`Geography` s, sites will be a
    :class:`numpy.ndarray`, but it may have other types.

    All subclasses of :class:`Geography` must provide the following methods:

    ``_coerce_to_sites``: Should coerce the input provided as sites into a
    sites object of the appropriate type.
    ``encode``: This function should return a dictionary of graph-specific
    parameters that must be passed to _C.run_system: the sites
    :class:`numpy.ndarray`, the graph_type integer, and optionally a
    neighborhoods, edges, and edge_idxs :class:`numpy.ndarrays`. Further
    requirements are discussed in the docstring for the ``encode`` method.
    ``decode``: This function should accept a dictionary in the same form
    returned by ``encode`` and convert it back to the sites property, of
    whatever class is used by this :class:`Geography`. Further requirements are
    discussed in the docstring for the ``decode`` method.

    Subclasses must also provide the following properties:

    ``num_directed_edges``: Number of directed edges in the graph. This is used
        in calculating rate scaling.

    Subclasses should provide the following properties:

    ``num_sites``: Number of vertices in the graph.

    Args:
        sites: The current state of the system.
        rules (Listr[str] or :class:`numpy.ndarray`): Rules for the system
          transition. This can be provided either as a 4-dimensional
          :class:`numpy.ndarray` where entry rules[i, j, k, l] gives the
          probability of the transition (i,j)->(k,l) in a single time step, or
          it can be provided as a list of strings given transition rules. See
          the add_rule method for how these strings are interpreted and
          converted into an array.
        generator (optional, int or :class:`numpy.random.Generator`): Random
          number generator. If an integer is provided, a new generator is
          constructed using that number as the seed for a default numpy random
          number generator.
        num_states (optional, int): Number of possible states in the system.
          This is only needed if you are specifying your rules as a list of
          strings.
