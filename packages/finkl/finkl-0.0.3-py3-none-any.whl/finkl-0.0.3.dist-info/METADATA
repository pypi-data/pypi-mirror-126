Learning Haskell by reimplementing its algebraic structures and classic
primitives in Python. Perhaps even usefully so!

## Install

    pip install finkl

## Abstract Base Classes

Where it makes sense -- and even where it doesn't -- Haskell's algebraic
typeclasses are implemented as Python abstract base classes (i.e., class
interfaces).

**Note** Type annotations are used throughout, but bear in mind that
Python does not enforce these nor does its type system lend itself to
Haskell's parametric polymorphism, so the correct type may not even be
expressible. Also, I'm only human...

### `finkl.abc`

Convenience imports at the package root:

* `Eq`
* `Functor`
* `Applicative`
* `Monoid`
* `Monad`

### `finkl.abc.eq`

#### `Eq`

Abstract base class for equality checking.

##### `__eq__`

Method implementation required: Python dunder method to implement
equality checking. Equivalent to Haskell's:

```haskell
(==) :: Eq a => a -> a -> bool
```

##### `__neq__`

Default implementation is the logical inverse of `__eq__`. Equivalent to
Haskell's:

```haskell
(/=) :: Eq a => a -> a -> bool
```

### `finkl.abc.functor`

#### `Functor[a]`

Abstract base class for functors over type `a`.

##### `fmap`

Method implementation required: Functor mapping, which applies the given
function to itself and returns a functor. Equivalent to Haskell's:

```haskell
fmap :: Functor f => f a -> (a -> b) -> f b
```

#### `Applicative[a, b]`

Abstract base class for applicative functors; that is, functors of
functions from type `a` to `b`.

##### `pure`

Class method implementation required: Return the functor from the given
value. Equivalent to Haskell's:

```haskell
pure :: Functor f => a -> f a
```

##### `applied_over`

Method implementation required: Return the functor created by appling
the applicative functor over the specified input functor. Equivalent to
Haskell's:

```haskell
(<*>) :: Functor f => f (a -> b) -> f a -> f b
```

**Note** Python's matrix multiplication operator (`@`) is overloaded to
mimic Haskell's `(<*>)`.

### `finkl.abc.monoid`

#### `Monoid[m]`

Abstract base class for monoids over type `m`.

##### `mempty`

Class variable definition required: the monoid's identity element.
Equivalent to Haskell's:

```haskell
mempty :: Monoid m => m
```

##### `mappend`

Method implementation required: The monoid's append function. Equivalent
to Haskell's:

```haskell
mappend :: Monoid m => m -> m -> m
```

##### `mconcat`

Default implementation folds over the given monoid values, using
`mappend` and starting from the identity element (`mempty`). Equivalent
to Haskell's:

```haskell
mconcat :: Monoid m => [m] -> m
```

### `finkl.abc.monad`

#### `Monad[a]`

Abstract base class for monads over type `a`.

##### `retn`

Class method implementation required: Return the monad from the given
value.  Equivalent to Haskell's:

```haskell
return :: Monad m => a -> m a
```

##### `bind`

Method implementation required: Monadic bind. Equivalent to Haskell's:

```haskell
(>>=) :: Monad m => m a -> (a -> m b) -> m b
```

**Note** Python's greater or equal than operator (`>=`) is overloaded to
mimic Haskell's `(>>=)`. Using `bind` may be clearer due to the operator
precedence of `>=`, which may necessitate excessive parentheses.

##### `then`

Default implementation does a monadic bind that supplants the monad with
the new, given monad. Equivalent to Haskell's:

```haskell
(>>) :: Monad m => m a -> m b -> m b
```

**Note** Python's right shift operator (`>>`) is overloaded to mimic
Haskell's `(>>)`. Using `then` may be clearer due to the operator
precedence of `>>`, which may necessitate excessive parentheses.

##### `fail`

Default implementation raises an exception with the given string. It
*should* return a monad from the given string. Equivalent to Haskell's:

```haskell
fail :: Monad m => String => m a
```

**Note** This function is used in Haskell's `do` notation, an analogue
of which is not currently implemented. As such, this is not an abstract
method and doesn't require an implementation.

## Implementations

### `finkl.util`

#### `identity`

Identity function. Equivalent to Haskell's:

```haskell
id :: a -> a
```

#### `compose`

Function composition. Equivalent to Haskell's:

```haskell
(.) :: (b -> c) -> (a -> b) -> (a -> c)
```

### `finkl.monad`

Convenience imports at the package root:

* `Maybe`, `Just` and `Nothing`
* `Writer`

#### `finkl.monad.maybe`

##### `Maybe`, `Just` and `Nothing`

Python doesn't have sum types, so `Just` and `Nothing` are just wrappers
that instantiate an appropriate `Maybe` object. You probably don't need
to use `Maybe` directly; you'd only need it for explicit type checking,
or when using `pure`/`retn`.

Implements:
* `Eq`
* `Applicative`
* `Monad`

**Note** The `Maybe` type is genericised over two type variables, as it
is an `Applicative`, which expects a function. This doesn't make a lot
of sense, but is required to satisfy Python's `Generic` interface.

Example:

```python
not Just(123) == Nothing
Just(123).fmap(lambda x: x + 1)
Just(lambda x: x + 1).applied_over(Just(123))
Just(123).bind(lambda x: Just(x + 1))
```

#### `finkl.monad.writer`

##### `Writer`

The "Writer" monad, which takes some value and a monoid context. The
`Writer` class shouldn't be instantiated directly, you should subclass
it and define a `monoid` class variable.

You can extract the monad's value and writer state by using the `value`
and `writer` properties, respectively.

Implements:
* `Monad`

Example:

```python
class Logger(Writer[int, str]):
    monoid = List  # finkl.monoid.List

def increment(x):
    return Logger(x + 1, List([f"Incremented {x}"]))

def double(x):
    return Logger(x * 2, List([f"Doubled {x}"]))

Logger.retn(0).bind(increment) \
              .bind(double) \
              .bind(increment)
```

**Note** The `Writer` class is genericised over the value type and the
type over the monoid (_not_ the monoid type). You're welcome.

### `finkl.monoid`

All the following implementations implement:
* `Eq`
* `Monoid`

#### `List`

Monoid over lists of any type.

Example:

```python
List.mconcat(List([1]), List([2]), List([3])) == List([1, 2, 3])
```

#### `Sum` and `Product`

Sum and product monoids over numeric types.

Example:

```python
Sum.mconcat(Sum(1), Sum(2), Sum(3)) == Product.mconcat(Product(1), Product(2), Product(3))
```

#### `Any` and `All`

Disjunction and conjunction monoids over Booleans.

Example:

```python
Any.mconcat(Any(False), Any(True), Any(False)) == Any(True)
All.mconcat(Any(True), Any(True), Any(False)) == Any(False)
```
