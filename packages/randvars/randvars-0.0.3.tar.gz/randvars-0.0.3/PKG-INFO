RandomVariates is a library of random variate generation routines.
The purpose behind this library was purely for educational purposes as 
a way to learn how to generate random variates using such methods as 
inverse transform, convolution, acceptance-rejection and composition 
methods. Additionally, this project was an excuse to get familiar with 
random number generators such as linear congruential generators, 
Tausworthe Generators and Widynski's "Squares: A Fast Counter-Based RNG"
