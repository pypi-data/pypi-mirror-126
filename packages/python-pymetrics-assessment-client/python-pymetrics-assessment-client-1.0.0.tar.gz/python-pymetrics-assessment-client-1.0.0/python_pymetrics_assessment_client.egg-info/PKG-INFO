Description:     ### This is pymetrics&#39;s public API for assessments, usually as part of a job application workflow. The typical use case for this is to support an externally initiated assessment for a candidate job application. This is often done \&quot;inline\&quot; with the candidate&#39;s application, or asynchronously after the candidate submits their application.  The expected sequence of API calls is: * &#x60;Generate OAuth Token&#x60; with the OAuth Client ID and Secret you&#39;ve been provided * &#x60;Get Assessment Configurations&#x60; to determine which configured assessment templates are available * &#x60;Create Assessment Order&#x60; for a selected Assessment and candidate job application * &#x60;Get Assessment Order&#x60; to receive the recommendation results, once they are available  # noqa: E501
