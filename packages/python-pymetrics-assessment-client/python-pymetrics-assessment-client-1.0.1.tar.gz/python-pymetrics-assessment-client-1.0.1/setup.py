    pymetrics Assessment API

    ### This is pymetrics's public API for assessments, usually as part of a job application workflow. The typical use case for this is to support an externally initiated assessment for a candidate job application. This is often done \"inline\" with the candidate's application, or asynchronously after the candidate submits their application.  The expected sequence of API calls is: * `Generate OAuth Token` with the OAuth Client ID and Secret you've been provided * `Get Assessment Configurations` to determine which configured assessment templates are available * `Create Assessment Order` for a selected Assessment and candidate job application * `Get Assessment Order` to receive the recommendation results, once they are available  # noqa: E501
