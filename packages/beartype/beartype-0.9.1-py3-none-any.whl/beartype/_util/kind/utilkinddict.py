def die_if_mappings_two_items_collide(

    '''
    Raise an exception if the two passed mappings contain a **key-value
    collision** (i.e., the same key such that the values associated with that
    key in these mappings differ).

    A key-value collision occurs when any key ``ka`` and associated value
    ``va`` of the first mapping and any key ``kb`` and associated value ``vb``
    of the second mapping satisfy ``ka == kb && va != vb``. Equivalently, a
    key-value collision occurs when any common keys shared between both
    mappings are associated with different values.

    Parameters
    ----------
    mapping_a: Mapping
        First mapping to be inspected.
    mapping_b: Mapping
        Second mapping to be inspected.

    Raises
    ----------
    _BeartypeUtilMappingException

def merge_mappings(*mappings: Mapping) -> Mapping:

    Safely merge all passed mappings if these mappings contain no **key-value
    collisions** (i.e., if these mappings either contain different keys *or*
    share one or more key-value pairs) *or* raise an exception otherwise (i.e.,
    if these mappings contain one or more key-value collisions).

    Since this function only safely merges mappings and thus *never* silently
    overrides any key-value pair of either mapping, order is insignificant;
    this function returns the same mapping regardless of the order in which
    these mappings are passed.

    Caveats
    ----------
    This function creates and returns a new mapping of the same type as that of
    the first mapping. That type *must* define an ``__init__()`` method with
    the same signature as the standard :class:`dict` type; if this is *not* the
    case, an exception is raised.

    Parameters
    ----------
    mappings: Tuple[Mapping]
        Tuple of two or more mappings to be safely merged.

    Returns
    ----------
    Mapping
        Mapping of the same type as that of the first mapping created by safely
        merging these mappings.

    Raises
    ----------
    _BeartypeUtilMappingException
        If either:

        * No mappings are passed.
        * Only one mappings are passed.
        * Two or more mappings are passed, but these mappings contain one or
