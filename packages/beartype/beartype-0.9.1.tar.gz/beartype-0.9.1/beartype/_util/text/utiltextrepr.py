    Pretty-printed quasi-human-readable variant of the string returned by the
    non-pretty-printed machine-readable :meth:`obj.__repr__` dunder method of
    the passed object, truncated to the passed maximum string length.

    Specifically, this function (in order):

    #. Obtains this object's representation by calling ``repr(object)``.
    #. If this representation is neither suffixed by a punctuation character
       (i.e., character in the standard :attr:`string.punctuation` set) *nor*
       representing a byte-string whose representations are prefixed by `b'`
       and suffixed by `'` (e.g., `b'Check, mate.'`), double-quotes this
       representation for disambiguity with preceding characters -- notably,
       sequence indices. Since strings returned by this function commonly
       follow sequence indices in error messages, failing to disambiguate the
       two produces non-human-readable output:

           >>> def wat(mate: typing.List[str]) -> int: return len(mate)
           >>> raise_pep_call_exception(
           ...     func=muh_func, pith_name='mate', pith_value=[7,])

           parameter mate=[7] violates PEP type hint typing.List[str], as list
           item 0 value 7 not a str.

       Note the substring "item 0 value 7", which misreads like a blatant bug.
       Double-quoting the "7" suffices to demarcate values from indices.
    #. If this representation exceeds the passed maximum length, replaces the
       suffix of this representation exceeding this length with an ellipses
       (i.e., `"..."` substring).

    Caveats
    ----------
    **This function is unavoidably slow and should thus not be called from
    optimized performance-critical code.** This function internally performs
    mildly expensive operations, including regular expression-based matching
    and substitution. Ideally, this function should *only* be called to create
    user-oriented exception messages where performance is a negligible concern.

    **This function preserves all quote-protected newline characters** (i.e.,
    ``"\\n"``) **in this representation.** Since the :meth:`str.__repr__`
    dunder method implicitly quote-protects all newlines in the original
    string, this function effectively preserves all newlines in strings.

    Parameters
    ----------
    obj : object
        Object to be represented.
    max_len: int, optional
        Maximum length of the string to be returned. Defaults to a standard
        line length of 100 characters minus output indentation of 4 characters.
