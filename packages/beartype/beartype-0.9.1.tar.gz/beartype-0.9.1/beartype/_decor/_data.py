# ....................{ TODO                              }....................
#FIXME: Optimize away the call to the inspect.signature() function by
#reimplementing this function to assign to instance variables of the current
#"BeartypeData" object rather than instantiating a new "Signature" object and
#then one new "Parameter" object for each parameter of the decorated callable.
#Note, for example, that we don't need to replicate that function's copying of
#parameter and return value annotations already trivially accessible via the
#"self.func.__annotations__" dunder attribute. Indeed, we only require these
#new "BeartypeData" instance variables:
#
#* "func_param_names", a tuple of all parameter names.
#* "func_param_name_to_kind", a dictionary mapping from each parameter name
#  (including the 'return' pseudo-parameter signifying the return value) to
#  that parameter's kind (e.g., keyword-only, variadic positional). Naturally,
#  parameter kinds should probably be defined as enumeration members of a
#  global public "Enum" class defined in this submodule and accessed elsewhere.
#
#Doing so will be non-trivial but entirely feasible and absolutely worthwhile,
#as the inspect.signature() function is *GUARANTEED* to be a performance
#bottleneck for us. This is low-priority for the moment and may actually never
#happen... but it really should.
#FIXME: Bwaha! We actually did this and even more space- and time-efficiently
#than the above scheme. See the new
#beartype.util.func.utilfuncargs.iter_func_args() generator, called like so:
#    for arg_name, arg_kind, _ in iter_func_args(func): ...
#*AWESOME.* Note we simply ignore the third item of each 3-tuple yielded by
#that generator, as we currently have *NO* need for default values. We will
#elsewhere certainly, but not quite yet. *shrug*

    '''
    **Beartype data** (i.e., object aggregating *all* metadata for the callable
    currently being decorated by the :func:`beartype.beartype` decorator).**

    Design
    ----------
    This the *only* object instantiated by that decorator for that callable,
    substantially reducing both space and time costs. That decorator then
    passes this object to most lower-level functions, which then:

    #. Access read-only instance variables of this object as input.
    #. Modify writable instance variables of this object as output. In
       particular, these lower-level functions typically accumulate pure-Python
       code comprising the generated wrapper function type-checking the
       decorated callable by setting various instance variables of this object.

    Caveats
    ----------
    **This object cannot be used to communicate state between low-level
    memoized callables** (e.g.,
    :func:`beartype._decor._code._pep._pephint.pep_code_check_hint`) **and
    higher-level callables** (e.g.,
    :func:`beartype._decor._code.codemain.generate_code`). Instead, memoized
    callables *must* return that state as additional return values up the call
    stack to those higher-level callables. By definition, memoized callables
    are *not* recalled on subsequent calls passed the same parameters. Since
    only the first call to those callables passed those parameters would set
    the appropriate state on this object intended to be communicated to
    higher-level callables, *all* subsequent calls would subtly fail with
    difficult-to-diagnose issues. See also `<issue #5_>`__, which exhibited
    this very complaint.

    Attributes
    ----------
    func : Optional[Callable]
        **Decorated callable** (i.e., callable currently being decorated by the
        :func:`beartype.beartype` decorator) if the :meth:`reinit` method has
        been called *or* ``None`` otherwise.
    func_sig : Optional[inspect.Signature]
        :class:`inspect.Signature` object describing this signature if the
        :meth:`reinit` method has been called *or* ``None`` otherwise.
    func_wrapper_code_call_prefix : Optional[str]
        Code snippet prefixing all calls to the decorated callable in the body
        of the wrapper function wrapping that callable with type checking if
        the :meth:`reinit` method has been called *or* ``None`` otherwise. If
        non-``None``, this string is guaranteed to be either:

        * If the decorated callable is synchronous (i.e., neither a coroutine
          nor asynchronous generator), the empty string.
        * If the decorated callable is asynchronous (i.e., either a coroutine
          nor asynchronous generator), the ``"await "`` keyword.
    func_wrapper_code_signature_prefix : Optional[str]
        Code snippet prefixing the signature declaring the wrapper function
        wrapping the decorated callable with type checking if the
        :meth:`reinit` method has been called *or* ``None`` otherwise. If
        non-``None``, this string is guaranteed to be either:

        * If the decorated callable is synchronous (i.e., neither a coroutine
          nor asynchronous generator), the empty string.
        * If the decorated callable is asynchronous (i.e., either a coroutine
          nor asynchronous generator), the ``"async "`` keyword.
    func_wrapper_locals : CallableScope
        **Local scope** (i.e., dictionary mapping from the name to value of
        each attribute referenced in the signature) of this wrapper function
        required by this code snippet.
    func_wrapper_name : Optional[str]
        Machine-readable name of the wrapper function to be generated and
        returned by this decorator if the :meth:`reinit` method has been called
        *or* ``None`` otherwise. To efficiently (albeit imperfectly) avoid
        clashes with existing attributes of the module defining that function,
        this name is obfuscated while still preserving human-readability.

        If :pep:`563` is conditionally active for this callable, this function
        additionally resolves all postponed annotations on this callable to

        ----------
        BeartypeDecorHintPep563Exception
            If evaluating a postponed annotation on this callable raises an
            exception (e.g., due to that annotation referring to local state no
            longer accessible from this deferred evaluation).
        BeartypeDecorWrappeeException
            If this callable is neither a pure-Python function *nor* method;
            equivalently, if this callable is either C-based *or* a class or
