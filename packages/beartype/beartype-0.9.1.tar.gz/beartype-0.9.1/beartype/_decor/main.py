**Beartype decorator.**

This private submodule implements the core :func:`beartype` decorator as well
as ancillary functions called by that decorator. The :mod:`beartype.__init__`
submodule then imports the former for importation as the public
:mod:`beartype.beartype` decorator by downstream callers -- completing the
virtuous cycle of code life.

This private submodule is *not* intended for importation by downstream callers.

:pep:`484`-compliant **generic callable type variable** (i.e., type hint
matching any arbitrary function or method).

This type variable notifies static analysis performed by both static type
checkers (e.g., :mod:`mypy`) and type-aware IDEs (e.g., VSCode) that the
:mod:`beartype` decorator preserves callable signatures by creating and
returning callables with the same signatures as the passed callables.

def beartype(func: T) -> T:
    '''
    Dynamically create and return a **constant-time runtime type-checker**
    (i.e., pure-Python function validating all parameters and returns of all
    calls to the passed pure-Python callable against all PEP-compliant type
    hints annotating those parameters and returns).

    The type-checker returned by this decorator is:

    * Optimized uniquely for the passed callable.
    * Guaranteed to run in O(1) constant-time with negligible constant factors.
    * Type-check effectively instantaneously.
    * Add effectively no runtime overhead to the passed callable.

    If optimizations are enabled by the active Python interpreter (e.g., due to
    option ``-O`` passed to this interpreter), this decorator silently reduces
    to a noop.

    Parameters
    ----------
    func : Callable
        **Non-class callable** (i.e., callable object that is *not* a class) to
        be decorated by a dynamically generated new callable wrapping this
        original callable with pure-Python type-checking.

    Returns
    ----------
    Callable
        Dynamically generated new callable wrapping this original callable with
        pure-Python type-checking.

    Raises
    ----------
    BeartypeDecorHintException
        If any annotation on this callable is neither:

        * A **PEP-compliant type** (i.e., instance or class complying with a
          PEP supported by :mod:`beartype`), including:

          * :pep:`484` types (i.e., instance or class declared by the stdlib
            :mod:`typing` module).

        * A **PEP-noncompliant type** (i.e., instance or class complying with
          :mod:`beartype`-specific semantics rather than a PEP), including:

          * **Fully-qualified forward references** (i.e., strings specified as
            fully-qualified classnames).
          * **Tuple unions** (i.e., tuples containing one or more classes
            and/or forward references).
    BeartypeDecorHintPep563Exception
        If :pep:`563` is active for this callable and evaluating a **postponed
        annotation** (i.e., annotation whose value is a string) on this
        callable raises an exception (e.g., due to that annotation referring to
        local state no longer accessible from this deferred evaluation).
    BeartypeDecorParamNameException
        If the name of any parameter declared on this callable is prefixed by
        the reserved substring ``__beartype_``.
    BeartypeDecorWrappeeException
        If this callable is either:

        * Uncallable.
        * A class, which :mod:`beartype` currently fails to support.
        * A C-based callable (e.g., builtin, third-party C extension).
    BeartypeDecorWrapperException
        If this decorator erroneously generates a syntactically invalid wrapper
        function. This should *never* happen, but here we are, so this probably
        happened. Please submit an upstream issue with our issue tracker if you
        ever see this. (Thanks and abstruse apologies!)

    #FIXME: Once this is working, use the commented code example starting with
    #"func_code_compiled = compile" given below to associate this filename with
    #this wrapper function.
    #FIXME: Unit test this to externally be the case for function wrappers
    #generated by @beartype, please.

    # Fake filename of the in-memory fake module file masquerading as declaring
    # this wrapper function. This filename guarantees the uniqueness of the
    # 3-tuple ``({func_filename}, {func_file_line_number}, {func_name})``
    # containing this filenames commonly leveraged by profilers (e.g.,
    # "cProfile") to identify arbitrary callables, where:
    # * `{func_filename}` is this filename (e.g.,
    #   `"</home/leycec/py/betse/betse/lib/libs.py:beartype({func_name})>"`).
    # * `{func_file_line_number}`, is *ALWAYS* 0 and thus *NEVER* unique.
    # * `{func_name}`, is identical to that of the decorated callable and also
    #   thus *NEVER* unique.
    #
    # Ergo, uniquifying this filename is the *ONLY* means of uniquifying
    # metadata identifying this wrapper function via runtime inspection.
    #
    # Note this filename is intentionally *NOT* prefixed and suffixed by the
    # "<" and ">" delimiters. Why? Because the stdlib linecache.lazycache()
    # function called below explicitly ignores filenames matching that
    # syntactic format, presumably due to the standard fake module filename
    # "<string>" applied by default to Python code dynamically generated by
    # the eval() and exec() builtins. Since Python occasionally emits in-memory
    # fake filenames resembling "memory:0x7f2ea8589810", we adopt a similar
    # syntax here to generate beartype-specific fake module filenames.
    # func_wrapper_filename = f'beartype_wrapper:{func_name_qualified}'

    #FIXME: Actually, we absolutely *DO* want to leverage the example
    #documented below of leveraging the compile() builtin. We want to do so
    #explicitly to pass something other than "<string>" here -- ideally,
    #"func.__code__.co_filename", ensuring that this wrapper function shares
    #the same absolute filename as that of the original function. To do so:
    #
    #* Implement the
    #  beartype._util.utilcallable.get_callable_filename_or_placeholder()
    #  getter.
    #* Call that function here to obtain that filename.
    #
    #Note that a similar example (also leveraging the exec() builtin, which
    #frankly seems excessive) is also given by:
    #    https://stackoverflow.com/a/42478041/2809027
    #
    #Failure to do so reduces tracebacks induced by exceptions raised by
    #this wrapper to non-human-readability, which is less than ideal: e.g.,
    #
    #    ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'betsee.util.widget.abc.guiwdgabc'
