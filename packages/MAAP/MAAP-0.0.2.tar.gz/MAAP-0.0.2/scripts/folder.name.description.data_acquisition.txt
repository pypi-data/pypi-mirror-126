The names of folders should follow the following nomenclature:

	(<house_division>|<event>)_<sound_conditions_environment>

	or

	test_.* -> means that is a folder used for testing


Examples for <house_division>:
	- living room
	- kitchen


Examples for <event>:
	- cooking
	- dinner

The possible <sound_conditions_environment> might be:

	- silent -> Most of the capture time is characterized by silent background (this is, no persons, no music, no background noise). Ex: capturing office sound, without anything making noise, but time to time, there is a noise from somewhere or appears someone

	- background.noise -> Most of the time is characterized by no persons talking and no complete silence. Example: office without no one, but if radio playing music

    - music

	- person{0-3} -> environment with persons. A number between 1-3 should be chosen. 1 -> one person; 2 - only two persons; 3 - more than 3 persons


Examples of folders:
1 -  office_background.nose
2 - dinner_person3
