apd-crs is a Python package for survival analysis with cure rate. I.e. time-to-event analysis using a dataset for which outcomes of a fraction of the dataset are unknown (censored), and for which some individuals never experience the event. This package can also be used for PU learning. I.e. binary classification with positive and unlabeled data

This package is based on original research work published [here](https://doi.org/10.1007/s00180-021-01140-0).
apd-crs is a work in progress and maintained by a team of researchers and developers from [Aimpoint Digital, LP](https://www.aimpointdigital.com).
