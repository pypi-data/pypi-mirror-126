# snapboost

## Hetergeneous Newton Boosting Machine
- Instead of using only decision trees as learners like XGBoost and LightGBM, HNBM uses a combination of decision trees and ridge regressors to learn more complicated patterns in data.

## Usage Instructions
* This project is published on [PyPI](https://pypi.org/project/snapboost/). To install package, run:

  ```
  pip install snapboost
  ```
