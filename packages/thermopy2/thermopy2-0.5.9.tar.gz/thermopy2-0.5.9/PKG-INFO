Python library for thermodynamics and other handy tools.


Thermodynamics (all these properties as function of temperature for thousands
of compounds):

	- Specific heat capacity

	- Enthalpy

	- Entropy


Temperature independent data:

	- Molecular weight

	- Enthalpy of formation


and much more.

For water pressure is also an input (higher accuracy).

Modelling of chemical reactions is also present. Main features:

	- Equilibrium constant as a function of temperature

	- Heat of reaction as a function of temperature


Handy tools:

	- Units conversion module

	- Hundreds of physical constants


See the documentation for further details and examples.
