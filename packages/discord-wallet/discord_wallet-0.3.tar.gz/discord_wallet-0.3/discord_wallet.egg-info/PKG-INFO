        ## Getting Started

        # currency_symbol is optional, and can be added in any call to update the bot's symbol in Wallet (defaults to $)
        
        wallet.add_to_wallet(bot_id, user_id, amount_of_currency, currency_symbol);
        
        wallet.remove_from_wallet(bot_id, user_id, amount_of_currency, currency_symbol);
        
        Wallet.check_balance(bot_id, user_id, currency_symbol);
        ```

        bot = commands.Bot(command_prefix = '!')
        
        @bot.command(name='wallet')
        async def _wallet(ctx, type_input, amount_input):
            if type_input == 'add':
                wallet.add_to_wallet(bot.user.id, ctx.message.author.id, int(amount_input))
        
                # remove the money from your database to match
        ```
