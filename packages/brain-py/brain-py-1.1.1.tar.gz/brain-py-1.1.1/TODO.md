# Version 1.1.0



## Base

- [ ] ``vars()``: must check whether has circular references
- [x] ``Collector``: must check whether the ``(key,value)`` pair are duplicate  (done @2021/08/26 by @chaoming)
- [x] ``nodes``: slove the problem of circular reference (done @2021/08/24 by @chaoming)
- [x] ``ints``: get integrators based on all nodes (done @2021/08/24 by @chaoming)
- [x] Reimplement ``nodes`` and ``ints`` in each children class, like Module, Sequential, DynamicaSystem, Container, Network (done @2021/08/24 by @chaoming)
- [x] ``ints``: "subsets()" method can get a subset of integrator, like ``ODE_INT``, ``SDE_INT``, etc. (done @2021/08/24 by @chaoming)





## Math

- [x] **[Numpy]**: JIT compilation in numpy backend supports ``Base`` and ``Function`` objects (done by chaoming@2021/09/08)
- [ ] **[Numpy]**: support JIT in `fft` sub-module
- [x] **[Numpy]:** support JIT compilation in numpy backend (done @ 2021.09.01 by @chaoming)
- [x] **[Numpy]:** support 'fft' (done @ 2021.09.03 by @chaoming)
- [ ] **[JAX]:** "random" module 
- [ ] **[JAX]:** math operations
- [ ] **[JAX]:** vmap
- [ ] **[JAX]:** pmap
- [ ] **[JAX]:** control conditions: 
- [ ] static_argnums
- [x] **[JAX]:** support 'fft' (done @ 2021.09.03 by @chaoming)
- [x] **[JAX]:** **IMPORTANT!!!** Change API of `grad()` and `value_and_grad()`: There are bugs in the gradient functions. Gradient computation also needs to inspect the variable types. Moreover, it is independent from the JIT function. Therefore, we should pass dynamical variables into the gradient functions too. (done @ 2021.08.26 by @chaoming)
- [x] **[JAX]:** **IMPORTANT!!!** change API of `vars()`: we should refer Dynamical Variables as `Variable`; We can not retrieve every "JaxArray" from `vars()`, otherwise the whole system will waste a lot of time on useless assignments. (done @ 2021.08.25 by @chaoming)
- [x] **[JAX]:** change API of `brainpy.math.jit(target)`, please return another class if `target` is not a function [abolished]

  - [x] register pytree  (done @ 2021.06.15 by @chaoming)

    - [x] functions in NumPy ndarray: any(), all() .... view() (done @ 2021.06.30 by @chaoming)
    - [x] functions in JAX DeviceArray: 
  - [x] numpy methods in JaxArray (done @ 2021.08.25, @2021.08.28 by @chaoming)
  - [x] documentation for JaxArray methods (done @ 2021.08.25 by @chaoming)
  - [ ] test for ndarray wrapper 
- [x] **[JAX]:** Support JIT in JAX (done @ 2021.07.30 by @chaoming)
