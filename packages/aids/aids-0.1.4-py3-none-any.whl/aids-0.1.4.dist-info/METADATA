#AIDScrapper

Based off a small script made by an Anonymous user. Now it's a full featured client which supports not only [AID][0] but also [Holo][0]. Alternatively, it can transform AID scenario objects in .scenario files for compatibility with the different AI Dynamic Storytelling platforms, speially [NAI][2]
The json files can be transformed into .html for better readbility although that's not the main purpose of this tool - you should upload it to one of the supported websites to use the stories.

# Requirements
To install all requirements, use the following snippet after installing python on your machine.

    pip install -r requirements.txt


# Testing
If you feel like messing around with the code make sure none of the tests are failing using the *test* command. It uses pytest if you have it installed or unittest as a fallback.
