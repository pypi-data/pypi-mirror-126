# PV_ICE: PV in the Circular Economy, Dynamic Energy and Materials TOOL

This open-source tool implements Circular Economy metrics for photovoltaic (PV) materials. It can be used to quantify and assign a value framework to efforts on re-design, reduction, replacement, reuse, recycling, and lifetime and reliability increases in the PV value chain.

The PV_ICE is leveraging published data from different sources on PV manufacturing and predicted technological changes. Input data is being compiled [here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1WV54lNAdA2uP6a0g5wMOOE9bu8nbwvnQDgLj3GuGojE/edit?usp=sharing)

This tool will help implement circularity metrics, quantify and assign a value framework to efforts on re-design, reduction, replacement, reusage, recycling, and lifetime and reliability increases on PV.


Documentation
=============

The calculator follows the following diagram for calculating Mass Flow. Baseline inputs are available in the PV_ICE \ baselines folder for US and World past and projected values. Full documentation can be found at [readthedocs](http://CircularEconomy-MassFlowCalculator.readthedocs.io/en/latest/).

[Input data](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1WV54lNAdA2uP6a0g5wMOOE9bu8nbwvnQDgLj3GuGojE/edit?usp=sharing) references include:

Real world installation data from IEA-PVPS reports for 1995 - 2010 (K. Bolcar and K. Ardani, “National Survey Report of PV Power Applications in the United States 2010,” IEA-PVPS, National Survey T1-19:2010, 2010. [Online]. Available: https://iea-pvps.org/national-survey-reports/.) Installation data 2010-2020 from U.S. Solar Market Insight 2020-yir from SEIA & Wood Mackenzie (M. Davis et al., “U.S. Solar Market Insight: 2020 Year in review,” Wood Mackenzie Power & Renewables, Mar. 2021.) All installation data is weighted by the marketshare of silicon PV, as derived from a combination of:

Installation projections either increase by 8.9% compound annual growth rate through 2050 (IRENA, “Future of Solar PV 2019,” IRENA, 2019. Accessed: Apr. 02, 2020. [Online]. Available: https://irena.org/-/media/Files/IRENA/Agency/Publication/2019/Nov/IRENA_Future_of_Solar_PV_2019.pdf.) or are drawn from NREL's Electrification Futures Studies (https://cambium.nrel.gov/?project=fc00a185-f280-47d5-a610-2f892c296e51).

Degradation rates (in percentage power loss per year) (D. C. Jordan, S. R. Kurtz, K. VanSant, and J. Newmiller, “Compendium of photovoltaic degradation rates,” Progress in Photovoltaics: Research and Applications, vol. 24, no. 7, pp. 978–989, 2016, doi: 10.1002/pip.2744.)

Reliability data, i.e. T50 and T90 lifetime in years (D. C. Jordan, B. Marion, C. Deline, T. Barnes, and M. Bolinger, “PV field reliability status—Analysis of 100 000 solar systems,” Progress in Photovoltaics: Research and Applications, vol. n/a, no. n/a, Feb. 2020, doi: 10.1002/pip.3262.)

Project Lifetime data in years from (R. Wiser, M. Bolinger, and J. Seel, “Benchmarking Utility-Scale PV Operational Expenses and Project Lifetimes: Results from a Survey of U.S. Solar Industry Professionals,” None, 1631678, ark:/13030/qt2pd8608q, Jun. 2020. doi: 10.2172/1631678.)

Each material is a compilation of multiple sources, most notably consistent with ITRPV data. Please see the Jupyter Journals for the derivations and sources of material baseline inputs.


Installation for PV ICE
