    """
    Regular NMS.
    For a given bbox, it will greedily discard all the other overlapping bboxes with lower score.
    Note that this implementation allows some sparsity in the process, by only checking boxes
    distant from less than `cutoff_distance`. See parameters for details.

    Note that this implementation could be further optimized:
    - Memory management is quite poor: several back and forth list-to-numpy conversions happen
    - Some multi treading could be injected when comparing far appart clusters

    Parameters
    ----------
    boxes : np.array
        Array of boxes, in format (x0, y0, x1, y1) with x1 >= x0, y1 >= y0
    scores : np.array
        One-dimensional array of confidence scores.
    iou_threshold : float, optional
        Threshold from which boxes are considered to overlap, and end up aggregated, by default 0.5
        The higher the lower the effect of this operation.
    score_threshold : float, optional
        Score from which to discard instance based on this confidence score, by default 0.1
    cutoff_distance : int, optional
        Distance from which boxes are considered too far appart to be considered, by default -1
        If two boxes are distant of more than this value, the iou score will not even be computed.
        Setting a positive value to this parameter will result in:
            - creating a BallTree indexed on top-left corner of bounding boxes
            - at each trimming step, the tree will be queried to return all the neighbors distant
            from less than `cutoff_distance` from the considered box in a O(log(n)) complexity
            (n=len(boxes))
    tree: str
        Type of tree to use. Either one of "kdtree" or "balltree". No critical difference in
        performances were observed during testing.


    Returns
    -------
    list
        List of indices to keep, sorted by decreasing score confidence
