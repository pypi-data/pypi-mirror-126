## About

This project is a proof of concept demonstration that **it is possible** to generate useful insights into a GitHub project via it's issue tracker.

Currently, this project generates graphs of:

- Number of open issues against days
- Number of closed issues against days
- Comparison of number of open and closed issues against days

## How to Run

### Note on Command Line Arguments

See [Command Line Arguments](#command-line-arguments) for program configuration from the command line

### From pip

1. Install `Python 3.9.6 +`
2. (Recommended) Create a *virtual environment* with `python3.9 -m venv env` and *activate* it
3. Run `pip install ssl-metrics-github-issues`
4. Generate a JSON data set with `ssl-metrics-github-issues-collect -r REPOSITORY -t GH_TOKEN -s FILENAME.json`
5. Generate graphs with `ssl-metrics-github-issues-graph -i FILENAME.json -o OPEN_ISSUES_GRAPH_FILENAME.* -c CLOSED_ISSUES_GRAPH_FILENAME.* -x JOINT_ISSUES_GRAPH_FILENAME`

### Command Line Arguments

#### ssl-metrics-github-issues-collect

- `-h`, `--help`: Shows the help menu and exits
- `-r`, `--repository`: GitHub repository to be used. Format needs to be "OWNER/REPO". Default is numpy/numpy
- `-t`, `--token`: [GitHub personal access token](https://docs.github.com/en/github/authenticating-to-github/keeping-your-account-and-data-secure/creating-a-personal-access-token)
- `-s`, `--save-json`: Save analysis to JSON file

#### ssl-metrics-github-issues-graph

##### Note on Graph Export Options

Arguements `-c`, `-o`, and `-x` can be of any of the formats that `matplotlibs.pyplot.savefig` function exports to.

- `-h`, `--help`: Shows the help menu and exits
- `-c`, `--closed-issues-graph-filename`: The filename of the output graph of closed issues
- `-i`, `--input`: The input JSON file that is to be used for graphing
- `-o`, `--open-issues-graph-filename`: The filename of the output graph of open issues
- `-x`, `--joint-issues-graph-filename`: The filename of the output graph of open and closed issues
